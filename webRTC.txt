1. webRTC ==> web based real time communication
2. webRTC is based on UDP ==> packets are lost unlike TCP network protocol
3. what happens in video calls when packets are lost is that we see a lag there or skip a few frames there.
4. webRTC was used because: A. browser support(browsers can speak webRTC), b. UDP falls back to TCP
5. we need to create a connection between browsers via webRTC
6. webRTC can be used for sending files, offline videos, audio.
7. Peer to peer means that two machines can directly talk to each other, without the intervention of the server.
8. P2P gives problems when we scale our app, for eg, when more than 2 people will be present in the meet talking to each other.
